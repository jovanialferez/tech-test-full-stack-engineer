### Analysis and Strategy
1. Navigation (with router)? or just state changes (with context)?
2. Identify components using atomic design system.
3. Run docker container to get initial mapping (in my head) from the UI fields against the database/data structure.
4. Leads refer to Jobs. (Leads in higher-level abstraction, jobs in lower-level).
5. Start with dummy while testing UI.
6. Proceed with api then.


nice to have
-- move to controllers
-- error handling with prompts/alerts/warnings on UI
-- acknowledgements on successful request
